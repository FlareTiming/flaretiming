title: Open Source Fallow
---
I started flare-timing 2017-03 to solve a problem and to promote Haskell.  The
problem is not solved and is hard. Hard because it is poorly defined. I'm
trying to write a reference implementation that scores hang gliding and
paragliding competitions according to the rules of those sports. CIVL [#]_, the
governing body for both sports tweaks the GAP_ rules each year at its plenary.

I'd like to get funded for working on it.  I've enrolled in the github
sponsorship program and have asked CIVL if they would support the project.

Tweag run an `Open Source Fellowship`_ for projects that advance the open
source software ecosystem. For this they favour **reproducible, shareable and
composable contributions**,  contributions that **align with community
interests and integrate in larger software ecosystems**. Does flare-timing do
this?
